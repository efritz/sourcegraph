# LSIF Typed protocol reference

An index contains one or more dimensions of intelligence about a given piece
of source code or software artifact. Complimentary dimensions can be merged
together from multiple sources to provide a unified code intelligence
experience.

Programs producing a file of this format is an "indexer" and may operate
somewhere on the spectrum between precision, such as indexes produced by
compiler-backed indexers, and heurstics, such as indexes produced by local
syntax-directed analysis for scope rules.

Indexes can be emitted and consumed "packed" or "streamed". See `PackedIndex`
and `IndexMessage`, respectively, for additional documentation.
### Document

A representation a text document belonging to the associated index decorated
with addiditonal intelligence. We assume that all relevant indexed documents
can be represented as a string. There is currently no support for binary
documents. The character encoding of a document is delcared by the associated
index's `Metadata.text_document_encoding` field.

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
|  **relative_path** | string | (Required) The path to the text document relative to the directory supplied in the associated `Index.project_root`. This value should not begin with a directory separator.
| repeated **occurrences** | Occurrence | (Optional) A set of occurrences that provide additional intelligence for some selection of source text within the document.


#### Occurrence

An occurrence associates a selection of source text with additional code
intelligence, such as highlighting rules or answers to common code
navigation queries such as finding hover text, definitions, references,
or implementations of the symbol at a specific source text position.

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| repeated **range** | uint32 | (Required) A range of contiguous characters in the enclosing text document expressed a half-open interval (start inclusive; end exclusive).
| repeated **relatives** | SymbolRelation | (Optional) A set of (directed) relationships between this occurrence and symbols also defined in the associated index. Values for this field may not be provided if this occurrence is used only for highlighting.
|  **highlight_class** | HighlightClass | (Optional) The type of syntax highlighting class that should be used for the associated range. If unspecified, no presentation properties are prescribed.

Additional notes on **range**:

(Required) A range of contiguous characters in the enclosing text
document expressed a half-open interval (start inclusive; end exclusive).

Both line and character offsets are zero-based. Make sure to adjust line
and character values before displaying them in an editor-like UI as
editors conventionally count from one.

This value must have exactly three or four elements of either the form
`[a, b, d]` or `[a, b, c, d]` where `a` is the starting line, `b` is the
starting column, `c` is the ending line, and `d` is the ending column.
The three-element form should only be usedÂ when `a = c`, i.e., the case
of single-line ranges. The initial encoding of ranges in this spec used a
`Range` message type that mirrors the structure of the equivalent type in
LSP. Benchmarks revealed we were able to reduce the total payload size of
the entire index by up to ~2x by using a `repeated int32` encoding
instead, which has an efficient packed encoding in Protobuf binary
payloads. efficient encoding. This value must have exactly three or four
elements of either the form `[a, b, d]` or `[a, b, c, d]` where `a` is
the starting line, `b` is the starting column, `c` is the ending line,
and `d` is the ending column. The three-element form should be used if
and only if `a = c`, i.e., the case of single-line ranges.

Lines exceeding the document line count or characters exceeding the
length of the target line will be interpreted as the maximum valid value
given the text document contents (and according to its encoding).

Special values like -1 to indicate the end of a line are not allowed. If
you want to specify a range that contains a line including the line
ending character(s) then use an end position denoting the start of the
next line.

For example: `[5, 23, 6, 0]`



##### HighlightClass

Possible tags associated with a selection of text within a document used
for syntax or semantic-directed highlighting.

| Number | Name | Description |
| ------ | ---- | ----------- |
| 0 | UnspecifiedHighlightClass | Unknown highlighting class. Do not apply special styling beyond the default "code style" for the associated range.
##### SymbolRelation

A description of the relationship between a source occurrence and a
symbol.

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
|  **symbol** | string | (Required) A reference to the target `SymbolInformation.symbol`. This symbol may be defined in the same associated index, or a remote one.
|  **relationship_type** | RelationshipType | (Required) The type of relationship between the target symbol and the source occurrence. See `Document.SymbolRelation.relationship_type` for additional documentation relating to each possible relationship type.
| repeated **override_documentation** | string | (Optional) Range-specific overrides for the documentation string defiend in the referenced symbol. This useful when the definition of a symbol may be parameteric, but the usage of a symbol may have refined typing information in the signature that would be more useful to display.



###### RelationshipType

The type of relationship between an occurrence and a symbol.

| Number | Name | Description |
| ------ | ---- | ----------- |
| 0 | UnspecifiedRelationshipType | (Invalid) Unknown relationship type.
| 1 | DefinitionOf | The source occurrence defines the target symbol (e.g., `x` in `val x = y`).
| 2 | ReferenceTo | The source occurrence references the target symbol, which is defined elsewhere (e.g., `y` in `val x = y`).
### IndexMessage

A representation of a portion of an index. An entire index can be represented
by a length-prefixed stream of index messages with the following ordering
constraints:

1. The first message in the stream is (the only) metadata message.
2. All symbol messages are emitted before any document message that
references it. Note that symbols may reference each other, and a symbol
object may not be logically "closed" until the end of the stream.

These constraints allow the index to be processed with minimal bookkeeping
overhead, and allows partial processing to stop early on successful match.

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
|  **metadata** | Metadata | Metadata about this index such as tool and protocol versioning and identification of the indexing environment.
|  **document** | Document | A representation of a decorated text document contained in in the analyzed source of this index.
|  **symbol_information** | SymbolInformation | A representation of an object within the analyzed source of this index. Referenced by one or more occurrences within the documents of this index, or externally from another index (by uniquely defined identifiers).



### Metadata

Metadata contains tool and protocol version information, indexer
self-identification, and data that encodes the indexing environment. Unlike
the other messages defined in this index, the contents of this message may
not be "stable" bewteen indexer invocations producing the same logical index
(for example, `Metadata.project_root` encodes the local working directory).

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
|  **protocol_version** | ProtocolVersion | (Required) An explicit version of the encoding used for this index. Changes to this value may change the interpretation of parsed strings (such as symbol identifiers) in tools consuming the index.
|  **tool_info** | ToolInfo | (Required) Information about the tool that created the index.
|  **project_root** | string | (Required) A URI-encoded absolute path to the root directory of this index. The documents also contained in the associated index are defined relative to this directory.
|  **text_document_encoding** | Encoding | (Required) The string encoding used to compute correct text selections within the text documents defining the indexed source code. Positions within text documents are expressed as zero-based line and character offsets based on the string representations of the text with the given encoding.




#### Encoding

Possible text document encodings.

| Number | Name | Description |
| ------ | ---- | ----------- |
| 0 | UnspecifiedEncoding | (Invalid) Unknown encoding. Consumers may attempt to choose a sane default or auto-detect an encoding of text documents when rendering selections of code.
| 1 | UTF8 | Text documents are encoded in UTF-8.
| 2 | UTF16 | Text documents are encoded in UTF-16 (e.g., TypeScript).
#### ProtocolVersion

Possible index protocol versions.

| Number | Name | Description |
| ------ | ---- | ----------- |
| 0 | UnspecifiedProtocolVersion | Currently, the only version available while the protocol is in design-flux. Once we are reasonably sure about the direction of this protocol, we will create a new non-zero version and enforce a version check in consumers for safety and forwards-compatibility.
#### ToolInfo

A description of the indexer (and the invocation) that produced the
associated index.

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
|  **name** | string | (Required) The name of the tool that created the associated index.
|  **version** | string | (Required) The version of the tool that created the associated index.
| repeated **arguments** | string | (Required) The list of command line arguments supplied to the indexer that created the associated index.



### PackedIndex

A representation of an index that can be emitted and consumed as as single
message payload. To write and consume a stream of messages instead, see
`IndexMessage`.

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
|  **metadata** | Metadata | (Required) Metadata about this index such as tool and protocol versioning and identification of the indexing environment.
| repeated **documents** | Document | (Optional) Representations of decorated text documents that compose the analyzed source of this index.
| repeated **symbol_information** | SymbolInformation | (Optional) Representations of objects within the analyzed source of this index. Referenced by one or more occurrences within the documents of this index, or externally from another index (by uniquely defined identifiers).



### SymbolInformation

A representation of an object within the analyzed source of this index that
may be referenced by one or more occurrences within this index, or externally
from another index (by uniquely defined identifiers).

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
|  **symbol** | string | (Required) An identifier of this symbol that uniquely identifies it within the associated index. This value may be used to reference the entire symbol information type from the fields `Document.Occurrence.SymbolRelation` and `SymbolInformation.SymbolRelation` also defined in the associated index.
|  **package** | Package | (Optional) The package in which this symbol is defined. Package values are compared bewteen distinct indexes to enable global navigation.
| repeated **documentation** | string | (Optional) The documentation payload for this symbol encoded as markdown. This field is repeated to allow different kinds of documentation. For example, separating signature from description.
| repeated **relatives** | SymbolRelation | (Optional) A set of (directed) relationships between this symbol and other symbols also defined in the associated index. These relationships define groups of symbols that should be transitively evaluated and treated as one entity when resolving specific types of code navigation queries. See `SymbolInformation.SymbolRelation.relationship_type` for additional documentation.

Additional notes on **symbol**:

(Required) An identifier of this symbol that uniquely identifies it
within the associated index. This value may be used to reference the entire
symbol information type from the fields
`Document.Occurrence.SymbolRelation` and `SymbolInformation.SymbolRelation`
also defined in the associated index.

Identifiers must begin with a protocol declaration, specifically the
prefix `{scheme}://`, that determines whether or not the
remainder of the value cn be used to extract semantic value. Note that we
do not expect this value to be a valid or parseable URI, nor do we expect
any particular encoding of the remaining payload.

Within a particular scheme, identifiers should be sufficiently unique so as
to avoid matching other symbols in other projects unless they actuall refer
to the same symbol. Symbol identifiers should be position-independent and
stable so that they can be used to identify symbols between documents and
projects.




#### Package

Package describes a publishable, versioned, and uniquely identifiable
artifact such as a Go module, an NPM or Python package, a Docker container,
a JVM dependency, or a Cargo crate.

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
|  **package_manager** | string | (Required) The name of the package manager (e.g., `gomod`, `npm`, `maven`).
|  **name** | string | (Required) The name of this package (e.g., `@types/react`, `com.google.guava:guava`).
|  **version** | string | (Required) The version of this package (e.g., `0.1.0`, `2.1.5`).



#### SymbolRelation

A description of the relationship between two symbols.

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
|  **symbol** | string | (Required) A reference to the target `SymbolInformation.symbol`. This symbol may be defined in the same associated index, or a remote one.
|  **relationship_type** | RelationshipType | (Required) The type of relationship between the target symbol and the source symbol. See `SymbolInformation.SymbolRelation.relationship_type` for additional documentation relating to each possible relationship type.


##### RelationshipType

The type of relationship between two symbols.

| Number | Name | Description |
| ------ | ---- | ----------- |
| 0 | UnspecifiedRelationshipType | (Invalid) Unknown relationship type.
| 1 | TypeReferenceTo | The source symbol has a type described by the target symbol.
| 2 | ImplementationOf | The source symbol is an implementation of the target symbol.

Additional notes on **TypeReferenceTo**:

The source symbol has a type described by the target symbol.

For example, symbols `s{1..3}` are all type references to symbol `S` in
the following:

```go
type S struct {}  // def S
var s1, s2, s3 S  // def s{1..3}, ref S
_ = s1            // ref s1
```

This type of relationship affords the "Go to type definition" code
navigation action.

Additional notes on **ImplementationOf**:

The source symbol is an implementation of the target symbol.

For example, symbols `S` and `S.M` are respective implementations of
symbols `I` and `I.M` in the following:

```go
type I interface{ M() }  // def I, def I.M
type S struct{}          // def S
func (S) M() {}          // ref S, def S.M
```

This type of relationship affords us the "Go to interface" and "Find
implementations" code naviagation actions; it can also expand the set
of results for a "Find references" operation, where references of the
interface include references of concrete types as well, but not the
reverse.

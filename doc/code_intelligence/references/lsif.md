# LSIF Typed protocol reference


### Document

A representation a text document decorated with addiditonal intelligence.
There is currently no meaningful support for binary documents. The character
encoding of a document is delcared by the associated index's
`Metadata.text_document_encoding` field.

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
|  **relative_path** | string | (Required) The path to the text document relative to the directory supplied in the associated `Index.project_root`. This value should not begin with a directory separator.
| repeated **occurrences** | Occurrence | (Optional) A set of occurrences that provide additional intelligence for some selection of source text within the document.
| repeated **symbols** | Symbol | Symbols that are defined within this document.



### Index

Index represents an LSIF index. An index can be consumed in a streaming
fashion by consuming one value at a time. In Java, use `parseDelimetedFrom`
to consume the index in a streaming fashion. For other languages like Go, you
need to write custom logic that decodes one LSIF `Value` at a time.

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
|  **metadata** | Metadata | Metadata about this index.
| repeated **document** | Document | Documents that belong to this index or the packages that are defined by this index.
| repeated **package** | Package | Packages that are either referenced from this index or the packages that are defined by this index.
| repeated **external_symbols** | Symbol | Symbols that are defined outside of this index but are referenced from inside this index.




### Metadata



| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
|  **tool_info** | ToolInfo | 
|  **project_root** | string | URI-encoded absolute path to the root directory of this index. All documents in this index must appear in a subdirectory of this root directory.
|  **position_encoding** | PositionEncoding |

| 1 | POSITION_ENCODING_UTF8 | 
| 2 | POSITION_ENCODING_UTF16 | 
### Occurrence

An occurrence associates a selection of source text with additional code
intelligence, such as highlighting rules or answers to common code
navigation queries such as finding hover text, definitions, references,
or implementations of the symbol at a specific source text position.

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| repeated **range** | int32 | (Required) A range of contiguous characters in the enclosing text document expressed a half-open interval (start inclusive; end exclusive).
|  **symbol_uri** | string | (optional) References the `Symbol.uri` field. Can be empty if this is only a highlighting occurrence.
|  **symbol_role** | Role | (optional) Is the symbol_uri defined or referenced at this occurrence?
| repeated **override_documentation** | string | (Optional) Range-specific overrides for the documentation string defiend in the referenced symbol. This useful when the definition of a symbol may be parameteric, but the usage of a symbol may have refined typing information in the signature that would be more useful to display.
|  **highlight** | Highlight | (optional) What syntax highlighting class should be used for this range?

Additional notes on **range**:

(Required) A range of contiguous characters in the enclosing text
document expressed a half-open interval (start inclusive; end exclusive).

Both line and character offsets are zero-based. Make sure to adjust line
and character values before displaying them in an editor-like UI as
editors conventionally count from one.

Lines exceeding the document line count or characters exceeding the
length of the target line will be interpreted as the maximum valid value
given the text document contents (and according to its encoding).

Special values like -1 to indicate the end of a line are not allowed. If
you want to specify a range that contains a line including the line
ending character(s) then use an end position denoting the start of the
next line. For example: `[5, 23, 6, 0]`.

This value must have exactly three or four elements of either the form
`[a, b, d]` or `[a, b, c, d]` where `a` is the starting line, `b` is the
starting column, `c` is the ending line, and `d` is the ending column.
The three-element form should only be used when `a = c`, i.e., the case
of single-line ranges. The initial encoding of ranges in this spec used a
`Range` message type that mirrors the structure of the equivalent type in
LSP. Benchmarks revealed we were able to reduce the total payload size of
the entire index by up to ~2x by using a `repeated int32` encoding
instead, which has an efficient packed encoding in Protobuf binary
payloads. efficient encoding. This value must have exactly three or four
elements of either the form `[a, b, d]` or `[a, b, c, d]` where `a` is
the starting line, `b` is the starting column, `c` is the ending line,
and `d` is the ending column. The three-element form should be used if
and only if `a = c`, i.e., the case of single-line ranges.

### Package

Package defines a publishable artifact such as an npm package, Docker
container, JVM dependency, or a Cargo crate.

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
|  **uri** | string | The unique identifier of this package that can be referenced from `Symbol.package_uri`.  This URI is not intended to be displayed to humans, but it's recommended to use a human-readable format to aid with debugging.
|  **name** | string | Name of this package, for example "@types/react" or "com.google.guava:guava".
|  **version** | string | Version of this package, for example "0.1.0" or "2.1.5".
|  **manager** | string | Package manager, for example "npm", "maven" or "cargo".




### Symbol

Symbol defines a symbol, such as a function or an interface.

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
|  **uri** | string | The identifier of this symbol, which can be referenced from Occurence. An empty uri means this symbol can be ignored.
|  **unique** | Unique | Determines whether this symbol is local to a single document or if can be referenced from multiple documents. Document symbols (`Document.symbols`) can be either local or global. External symbols (`Index.external_symbols`) must be global.
| repeated **documentation** | string | (optional, but strongly recommended) The markdown-formatted documentation for this symbol. This field is repeated to allow different kinds of documentation.  For example, it's nice to include both the signature of a method (parameters and return type) along with the accompanying docstring.
|  **package_uri** | string | (optional) Links to the original package that defines this symbol to enable navigation across different LSIF indexes (whether they come from different projects or git repositories). This field must be non-empty for toplevel symbols (`Value.value`).
| repeated **reference_symbols** | string | (optional) Symbols that should be included together with this symbol when resolving "find references".  For example, the symbol of a TypeScript or Java method that implements an interface method should list the interface method here.
| repeated **implementation_symbols** | string | (optional) Symbols that are "implemented" by this symbol. For example, the symbol of a TypeScript or Java class that implements an interface should list the interface here.
